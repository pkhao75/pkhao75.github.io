I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a background in audio engineering. After working as an audio engineer for live performances and studios, I found that my interest has been in the software and programming behind audio technology. That interest drives me to start a new journey in computer science. I am motivated to apply my knowledge in audio and CS together to drive an innovative project in the tech field.

# Movie List Manager
### Northeastern University, Summer 2024
### Java, Swing

This is a group final project for my Object Oriented Design class. A Java Swing GUI apllication for managing movies watchlist. Users are allows to add/remove and filter the list of movies they want into their watchlist. Search function is implemented utilizing OMDb API to fetch new movies into the database.

The application utilizes MVC model for organized structure and separate database from user interface. I was in charged of serializing database and the interaction between model and controller.
